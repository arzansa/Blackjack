# Blackjack
Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games due to its low house edge. It is also a deceptively simple game to program with additional features for added difficulty (splitting, multiple hands, etc.). I've played a lot of online BlackJack games and I wanted to try programming it myself. This game currently allows for only 1 hand and no splitting but I plan to add those features soon.

# Screenshots

The game starts on the wagering screen where the player can select chips to place their bet:

The dealer and player will then both be dealt cards and the player will have the option to hit or stand:

After standing (or the player has busted (cards total over 21)) the dealer's hidden card will be revealed, and the dealer will then draw up to 17, and if the player's card total is greater than the dealer's and they have not busted, they will win back double their wager:
